# SelfCycle
**One-Sided Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Self Cycle Constraints**  

---

## 🔍 What is SelfCycle?

SelfCycle is a **one-sided, unpaired** image-to-image (I2I) translation framework that adds *Self Cycle* constraints to the generator itself, removing the need for a reverse network or paired data.  
It re-examines generated images through **triplet contrastive learning**, pushing their features closer to the target domain and away from the source domain.
